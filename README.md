# Mobile Controller Project

This project is a simple web application that allows you to control the movement of a box on the screen using a mobile device.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of websockets to enable real-time communication between a client and a server. The project consists of two parts: a backend server built using Node.js and Socket.IO, and a frontend client built using React.

### Installation

To run the project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website.

After installing Node.js and npm, follow these steps:

1-Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2-Navigate to the backend directory and run npm install to install the dependencies.

3-Navigate to the directory and run npm install to install the dependencies.

### Running the project

To run the project, open two terminal windows:

In the first terminal window, navigate to the backend directory and run npm start.

In the second terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory and run npm start.

This will start the backend server and the frontend client, respectively.

### How it works

The frontend client consists of a simple web page with four directional buttons that allow you to control the movement of a box on the screen. The web page is designed to be responsive and can be accessed from a mobile device.

### Final Words
This project is just for demonstration not an actual product, it provide a simple webpage you can go to game route and open mobile controller on your touch devices (iphone, andriod etc.) to enjoy it.
